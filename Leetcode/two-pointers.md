# Two Pointers (2 Pointer) Techniques in LeetCode Problems

## Basic Knowledge

- **Common two-pointer algorithms** include same-direction, opposite-direction, and meeting-in-the-middle.
- **Same-direction pointers** move in the same direction.
- **Opposite-direction pointers** move toward each other.
- **Meeting-in-the-middle pointers** start from both ends and meet in the middle.

### Opposite-direction Pointers:
