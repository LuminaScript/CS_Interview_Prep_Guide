# Basic Knowledge

Binary search is a fundamental technique with a time complexity of O(logN). Common binary search problems can be categorized into explicit and implicit types.

## Explicit Binary Search:

- [Leetcode 34. Find First and Last Position of Element in Sorted Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-first-and-last-position-of-element-in-sorted-array/)
- [Leetcode 33. Search in Rotated Sorted Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/search-in-rotated-sorted-array/)
- [Leetcode 1095. Find in Mountain Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-in-mountain-array/)
- [Leetcode 162. Find Peak Element](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-peak-element/)
- [Leetcode 278. First Bad Version](https://leetcode.com/problems/first-bad-version/)
- [Leetcode 74. Search a 2D Matrix](https://leetcode.com/problems/search-a-2d-matrix/)
- [Leetcode 240. Search a 2D Matrix II](https://leetcode.com/problems/search-a-2d-matrix-ii/)

## Implicit Binary Search:

- [Leetcode 69. Sqrt(x)](https://leetcode.com/problems/sqrtx/)
- [Leetcode 540. Single Element in a Sorted Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/single-element-in-a-sorted-array/)
