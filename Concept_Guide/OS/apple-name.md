Apple Questions

> Hi Yizhen, 
>
> We are hiring Software Engineers onto our Networking Group in both San Diego and Cupertino. These teams work on the core networking stack OS components used in the majority of Apple's platforms - focusing on compromise between performance (throughput and latency), energy efficiency (CPU and memory usage), ease of use and security. It is a mix of kernel and userspace networking infrastructure.

> We are looking for SW Engineers at all levels and looking for people more interested in solving kernel problems. 
>
> This team owns technologies like Kernel Bypass, Offloading, TCP/IP stack, Skywalk, InternetSharing, IPSec, DPDK, RDMA and actively engage with HW teams to co-design HW/SW systems that works more efficiently.
